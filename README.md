<h2>Topics of Discussion</h2>
<p>CLI's are quite a problem to solve</p>
<p>Probably could've DRY'ed it up a little more</p>
<p>Grabbing from dynamically generated objects</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you want a huge list of people on your page, make sure you ADD THEM ALL before exiting choices, as it creates a file that you will not be able to keep adding to after file is created</li>
  <li>Enjoy yourself and feast your eyes on a working cli application</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Appending information that user created from cli to an object</li>
  <li>Implementation of interpolation</li>
  <li>Staring at the screen and thinking about one thing at a time.... very hard</li>
</ul>

<p>Without the help from these guys, I'm pretty positive I would not understand as much as I do now.</p>
